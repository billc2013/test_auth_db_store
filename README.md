# Auth0 + Firebase + WebR Integration

## Overview
This application demonstrates a secure integration between Auth0 authentication, Firebase services, and WebR, enabling browser-based R computation with persistent state. It uses a modular, component-based architecture with vanilla JavaScript and maintains strict CORS headers for security.

## Live Demo
Current version is hosted at: https://testauthfirebase.netlify.app

## Core Features
- Auth0 Authentication (Login/Logout)
- WebR Integration
  - Browser-based R REPL
  - State persistence between sessions
  - Plot generation and storage
- Firebase Integration
  - Firestore for state management
  - Storage for plot images
- Custom Web Components
- Secure CORS Configuration

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Authentication**
   - Auth0 configuration and service layer
   - Login button component
   - User session management

2. **WebR Integration**
   - REPL interface
   - State management
   - Plot generation

3. **Database Operations**
   - Firebase Firestore for state
   - Firebase Storage for plots
   - Real-time updates handling

### Security Features
- CORS Headers Configuration for cross-origin isolation
- Secure token management
- Graceful connection cleanup

## Development Notes

### CORS Configuration
The application requires specific CORS settings to enable:
- WebR's SharedArrayBuffer requirements
- Firebase Storage access
- Secure cross-origin isolation

Development-only storage rules are in place - must be updated for production.

### State Management
- Command history persistence
- Session state restoration
- Plot storage and retrieval

### Future Enhancements
1. Secure Storage Rules
   - Implement proper authentication for Firebase Storage
   - Add user-specific access controls

2. Enhanced R Features
   - File upload/download
   - Package management
   - Advanced plotting options

3. Collaborative Features
   - Shared workspaces
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Session sharing
